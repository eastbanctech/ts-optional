### Travis CI
Build descriptor for the project is '.travis.yml' file.
 
To integrate with the CI: 
- github [personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) should be generated. 
    - Generated value should be defined in Travis as _GH_TOKEN_ 
[environment variable](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-variables-in-repository-settings) for _master_ branch.
- npm account email should be defined as _NPM_EMAIL_ environment variable for all branches.
- npm [access tokens](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-authentication-tokens) should be defined as _NPM_TOKEN_ environment variable for all branches.

### How to release (deploy npm package)
Travis will deploy all tags: 'Tagged commit' == 'new release'.

Generally [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) command should be applied.

To make a release:
1. Checkout _master_ branch.
2. Run command `npm version patch`
3. Push changes: ` git push origin HEAD:master --tags`

Will be created a commit with new version number as a message. For example: _'v0.1.0'_.
Travis will deploy the new version.
